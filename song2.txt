Marina - To Be Human

The pagodas and the palaces dressed in gold leaf
Hide the damages
Spot the Geisha as she balances
Life's a cakewalk, full of challenges

Go to Russia, see the Red Square
Lenin's body lying dead there
From Kyoto, Hiroshima
Watch the black cloud crawling nearer

There were riots in America
Just when things were getting better
All the things I've done and seen
Still I don't know what life means

All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (ooh)
All the things that I've done and I've seen
Still I don't know, don't know what it means

Fly to Athens, pass the Parthenon
See the village where my father's from
To Chicago from Angola
SÃ£o Paulo to Verona

And anywhere you go, you'll see (o-o-oh)
People are just like you and me (o-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
All the things I've done and seen
Still I don't know what life means

All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (ooh)
All the things that I've done and I've seen
Still I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
Still I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

I like to think about how we all look from afar
People driving fancy cars look like beetles to the stars
The missiles and the bombs sound like symphonies gone wrong
And if there is a God they'll know why it's so hard

To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
To be hu-
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

I want connection (To be human)
I want to feel human again
Lost my direction (To be human)
I want to feel human again

To be human
To be human
To be human
To be human
